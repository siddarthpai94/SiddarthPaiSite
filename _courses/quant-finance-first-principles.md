Most quant finance content is either too academic (theorem-proof-theorem) or too shallow (here's a moving average crossover). This course sits in the middle — rigorous enough to be useful, practical enough to apply.

## Who is this for?

Software engineers curious about finance, finance professionals wanting to build quantitative skills, or anyone who wants to understand how the math behind Wall Street actually works. If you can write basic Python, you're ready.

## My approach

I come from the engineering side — I built fraud detection and risk systems at JP Morgan processing millions of financial events daily. I've seen how quantitative models work (and break) in production. This course reflects that practitioner's lens: we'll build intuition first, then formalize it, then code it.

## What you'll build

By the end of this course, you'll have a working Python toolkit including a Black-Scholes options pricer, Monte Carlo simulation engine, portfolio optimizer using mean-variance analysis, a basic backtesting framework you can extend, and Value-at-Risk calculator with historical and parametric methods.

## Prerequisites

Basic Python skills (loops, functions, numpy/pandas). High school math — we'll build up the statistics and calculus intuition you need along the way. No finance background required.
