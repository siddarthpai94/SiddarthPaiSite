AI in finance isn't just hype — but it's also not magic. This course separates the real applications from the noise, with a focus on systems that actually work in production at financial institutions.

## Why I'm qualified to teach this

I built ML-driven fraud detection pipelines at JP Morgan Chase, processing millions of financial events with real-time Kafka streaming and strict regulatory compliance. Before that, I published original research on federated learning and distributed ML systems at GE Healthcare, and presented at IIM Ahmedabad's international conference. This isn't theoretical — it's drawn from building and operating these systems in production.

## Who is this for?

This is for ML engineers who want to apply their skills to finance, financial professionals who want to understand what AI can (and can't) do, data engineers building the infrastructure that ML systems depend on, and anyone interested in the intersection of AI and financial services.

## What makes this different

Most "AI in finance" content focuses on algorithmic trading with toy datasets. This course covers the full stack — the data pipelines, the model architecture, the deployment infrastructure, the monitoring, and critically, the regulatory and compliance constraints that determine what you can actually ship in a financial institution.

## What you'll build

Working Python implementations of a real-time fraud scoring system architecture, NLP pipeline for extracting sentiment from SEC filings, time series forecasting model with proper backtesting, feature store design for financial ML, and a model monitoring dashboard for detecting drift.

## Prerequisites

Solid Python skills. Familiarity with basic ML concepts (supervised learning, train/test splits, common algorithms). Some exposure to pandas and scikit-learn. Finance domain knowledge is helpful but not required — we'll cover the context.
