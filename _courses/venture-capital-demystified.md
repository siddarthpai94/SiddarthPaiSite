Venture capital is one of the most influential but least understood corners of finance. Most content about VC is either insider jargon or motivational fluff. This course is neither — it's a structured, honest breakdown of how the industry works.

## Why I made this

As a founder who raised seed funding for Bookmymantap, I learned VC from the other side of the table — pitching, negotiating, and navigating the fundraising process with zero prior connections. That experience, combined with my time in financial systems at JP Morgan and data platforms at Walmart, gives me a unique lens on how capital, technology, and product intersect.

## Who is this for?

This course is for founders who want to understand how VCs think before they walk into a pitch, aspiring VCs or analysts who want a structured foundation, tech professionals curious about how the startup ecosystem is funded, and MBA students who want the practical version, not just the case study version.

## What you'll learn

You'll understand the complete lifecycle of a VC fund — how money flows from LPs to startups and back, how to read and negotiate a term sheet, why VC returns follow a power law and what that means for strategy, how to evaluate startups the way investors do, and the real paths into venture capital from tech, finance, and operating roles.

## My teaching philosophy

I explain things the way I wish someone had explained them to me — with concrete examples, real math, and zero hand-waving. Every concept gets grounded in a real scenario.

## Prerequisites

None. Genuine curiosity about how startups get funded is all you need.
