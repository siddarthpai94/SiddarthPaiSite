When I founded Bookmymantap, I had a working product, a small team, and zero idea how fundraising actually worked. Here's what I learned the hard way.

## The pitch deck isn't what you think it is

I spent weeks perfecting our deck — beautiful slides, TAM/SAM/SOM analysis, five-year financial projections. None of that mattered as much as the first 60 seconds of the conversation.

Investors are pattern-matching machines. In that first minute, they're asking themselves: Does this founder understand the problem deeply? Is there evidence that users care? Can this person execute?

Your deck is a leave-behind, not a persuasion tool. The conversation is the pitch.

## Rejections are data, not verdicts

We got rejected a lot. But the useful rejections — the ones where the investor explained *why* — were worth more than the polite passes. "Your unit economics don't work at this scale" is actionable. "Not the right fit for our fund" is not.

I started asking every investor who passed: "If you were building this company, what would you do differently?" The best ones gave genuinely useful answers.

## What actually got us funded

Three things convinced our lead investor to write the check: demonstrated user behavior (people were booking venues through our beta without being asked to), clear articulation of why *now* (the event venue market was digitizing and no one owned the consumer experience), and evidence that I could build — not just pitch.

That last point matters more than founders realize. VCs are betting on the builder, not the plan. Showing working software beats showing projections every time.

## What I'd do differently

I'd start talking to investors three months before I needed money. Not to pitch — to build relationships and get feedback on the market thesis. The founders who raise fastest are the ones who've been in the investor's inbox (helpfully, not desperately) for months before the ask.
